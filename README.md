# Greenhouse Gases Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Steps: 
    - Create One Datasets combining txt and csv datasets
    - Feature engineering with creatinng new variables from exists
    - Line, Bar, Histogram, Errorbar, Box, Scatter, Stem plots examples
    
* I created this Datasetcombining NOAA - Global Monitoring Laboratory's studies on greenhouse gases

* Dataset has nearly two decade data 

* Dataset is about monthly measuring the atmospheric distribution and trends of the main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

### Variables

**relative_temp** : relative temperature values according to reference temperature

**relative_co2** : relative co2 value according to next measurement

**relative_ch4** : relative ch4 value according to next measurement

**relative_n2o** : relative n2o value according to next measurement

**relative_sf6** : relative sf6 value according to next measurement

**CO2**: Data are reported as a dry air mole fraction defined as the number of molecules of carbon dioxide divided by the number of all molecules in air, including CO2 itself, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as parts per million (ppm). Example: 0.000400 is expressed as 400 ppm.

**CH4**: Methane is reported as a “dry air mole fraction”, defined as the number of molecules of methane divided by the total number of molecules in the sample, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as nmol mol-1, abbreviated “ppb” (for parts per billion; 1 ppb indicates that one out of every billion molecules in an air sample is CH4).

**N2O**: Nitrous oxide is reported as a “dry air mole fraction”, defined as the number of molecules of nitrous oxide divided by the total number of molecules in the sample, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as nmol mol-1, abbreviated “ppb” (for parts per billion; 1 ppb indicates that one out of every billion molecules in an air sample is N2O).

**SF6**: Sulfur hexafluoride is reported as a “dry air mole fraction”, defined as the number of molecules of sulfur hexafluoride divided by the total number of molecules in the sample, after water vapor has been removed. The mole fraction is expressed as pmol mol-1, abbreviated “ppt” (for parts per trillion; 1 ppt indicates that one out of every trillion molecules in an air sample is SF6).
